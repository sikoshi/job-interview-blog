# job-interview-blog

Task is to build sample blog from scratch without any framework or library. This is all about showing software architecture skills.

Pages:
1. Posts list
2. Post page
3. Post composing page
4. Authentication page

Features:

1. Only logged in user will add posts
2. Anybody can comment posts

Notes:
Unfortunately, i cant use any 3rd party library, so i have to implement routing, security input filtering, template engine, etc by myself or use native PHP tools.
I have to use something like sqlite to make application easier to deploy.
